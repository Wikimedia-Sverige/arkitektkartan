Arkitektkartan
====

This is a map that shows data from Wikidata about architects and the buildings they built.

Available online at: . . . 

It is developed by Wikimedia Sverige within the project *A Network of Places: Open Linked Building Data as Research Infrastructure*, a collaboration with ArkDes, the Swedish National Heritage Boardâ€™s archive, the National Museum of Fine Arts and the National Museum of Science and Technology.

As the focus of the project is Swedish architecture, the current initial version of the map prioritizes Swedish labels and descriptions from Wikidata, and the interface is also in Swedish.
